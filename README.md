# checkRepositories
Challenge made by my friend [vvesly](https://github.com/vvesly/) (go check his Github) .Using the github API with only vanilla JS. 


Could have done using libraries like JQuery or even Axios, but I decided to go with vanilla JS for learning sakes.
The JQuery is included because of Bootstrap. 
Done so I could practice AJAX(promises) and DOM.
